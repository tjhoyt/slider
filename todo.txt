Main goal: to make a GUI functionality to toggle options on distance measurements
    a.) 2 way sliding bar to choose a date range @@@ Done! @@@
    b.) 2 way sliding bar to choose a lmc mod range @@@ Done! @@@
    c.) check boxes to choose objects -- no! Just one object at a time; makes more sense
    d.) check boxes select measurement methods

2.) Find a way to weight the histogram counts by the (inverse) error on the
measurement.

3.) Find a prettier way to handle when min goes higher than max


Additional:
    a.) Radio button(s) for weighted by error, by recentness, or both
    b.) Add object radio buttons and a while loop similar to the methods
    loop to grab mutliple objects from NED
    c.) Stop the rebinning with each new slide so a change in counts can be seen better
    d.) Fix the transparency issues (again)
